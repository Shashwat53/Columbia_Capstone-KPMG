Updates to Billing Requirements for Children’s HCBS and CFTSS
To: Children’s Home and Community Based Service (HCBS) Providers, Children and Family
Treatment and Support Services (CFTSS) Providers, and Medicaid Managed Care
Plans (MMCPs) including Mainstream Managed Care and HIV Special Needs Plans
(HIV-SNPs)
Date: September 5, 2023
The Department of Health (DOH), in collaboration with the Office of Mental Health (OMH),
Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS), Office for People with Developmental
Disabilities (OPWDD) and the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS), is implementing a
billing change that will allow claims for Children’s Home and Community Based Services
(HCBS) and Children and Family Treatment Support Services (CFTSS) to be paid based on the
county in which services were provided, rather than a provider’s corporate headquarters or
central office address, effective December 1, 2023. This update is necessary to align with the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) billing requirements, which dictate that
services must be reimbursed based on the location of service delivery.
DOH will announce two webinars to be held regarding this change, one for providers and one
for MMCPs:
The State has assigned a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code and a proxy
locator code to each county in New York State. The applicable FIPS (if submitting electronically)
or proxy locator (if submitting on paper) county code, indicating service location, must be
included on all Children’s HCBS and CFTSS claims submitted for dates of service on or after
December 1, 2023. The county FIPS and proxy locator codes are as follows:

Submitting Electronic Claims
When submitting an electronic claim for Children’s HCBS or CFTSS effective for claims with
dates of service on or after December 1, 2023, providers must enter Value Code 85 plus the
applicable FIPS code from the list above in the Value Code box of the claim. Providers must
continue to include any other value code that is necessary to accurately report the claim (e.g.,
rate code) in this box.
Submitting Paper Claims
When submitting paper claims for Children’s HCBS or CFTSS effective for claims with dates of
service on or after December 1, 2023, providers must enter Value Code 61 plus the
applicable proxy locator code from the list above in the Value Code box of the claim.
Providers must continue to include any other value code that is necessary to accurately report
the claim (e.g., rate code) in this box.
Systems Updates
The eMedNY system is being reconfigured to associate FIPS codes to the correct proxy locator
codes to ensure the correct reimbursement amount is paid for each Fee for Service claim1.
MMCPs must configure their systems to be able to accept the new billing changes from
providers and pay claims correctly; and to be able to submit claims to FFS for any non-risk
payments. MMCPS have 90 days from the date of this announcement to configure their systems
to align with these requirements and begin paying claims based on the location of service
delivery for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023. Providers will hold managed care
claims for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023.
The HCBS Manual, CFTSS Manual, and MCTAC Billing Tool will be updated to reflect this
change in billing guidance.
Questions about this update can be sent to: BH.Transition@health.ny.gov
1 As a result of system reconfigurations, agencies may receive an auto-generated letter from eMedNY including
information related to FIPS codes/proxy locator codes and their effective date. System effective dates may not
align with program/policy effective dates. Providers must follow the guidance found in this announcement and any
subsequent announcements released by DOH for accurate information on effective dates and policy implications.
