This update is necessary to align with the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) billing requirements, which dictate that\nservices must be reimbursed based on the location of service delivery.\nDOH will announce two webinars to be held regarding this change, one for providers and one\nfor MMCPs:\nThe State has assigned a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code and a proxy\nlocator code to each county in New York State. The applicable FIPS (if submitting electronically)\nor proxy locator (if submitting on paper) county code, indicating service location, must be\nincluded on all Children’s HCBS and CFTSS claims submitted for dates of service on or after\nDecember 1, 2023. The county FIPS and proxy locator codes are as follows:\nFederal Information Processing Proxy Locator Code for Paper Rate Region\nStandards (FIPS) County Code for Claims\nElectronic Claims\nCode County Code County Rate Region\n36001 Albany County 901 ALBANY Upstate\n36003 Allegany County 902 ALLEGANY Upstate\n36005 Bronx County 958 BRONX (The Bronx) Downstate\n36007 Broome County 903 BROOME Upstate\n36009 Cattaraugus County 904 CATTARAUGUS Upstate\n36011 Cayuga County 905 CAYUGA Upstate\n36013 Chautauqua County 906 CHAUTAUQUA Upstate\n36015 Chemung County 907 CHEMUNG Upstate\n36017 Chenango County 908 CHENANGO Upstate\n36019 Clinton County 909 CLINTON Upstate\n36021 Columbia County 910 COLUMBIA Upstate\n36023 Cortland County 911 CORTLAND Upstate\n36025 Delaware County 912 DELAWARE Upstate\n36027 Dutchess County 913 DUTCHESS Downstate\n36029 Erie County 914 ERIE Upstate\n36031 Essex County 915 ESSEX Upstate\n36033 Franklin County 916 FRANKLIN Upstate"

MMCPS have 90 days from the date of this announcement to configure their systems\nto align with these requirements and begin paying claims based on the location of service\ndelivery for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023. Providers will hold managed care\nclaims for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023.\nThe HCBS Manual, CFTSS Manual, and MCTAC Billing Tool will be updated to reflect this\nchange in billing guidance.\nQuestions about this update can be sent to: BH.Transition@health.ny.gov\n1 As a result of system reconfigurations, agencies may receive an auto-generated letter from eMedNY including\ninformation related to FIPS codes/proxy locator codes and their effective date. System effective dates may not\nalign with program/policy effective dates. Providers must follow the guidance found in this announcement and any\nsubsequent announcements released by DOH for accurate information on effective dates and policy implications.\nPage 3 of 3"

This update is necessary to align with the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) billing requirements, which dictate that\nservices must be reimbursed based on the location of service delivery.\nDOH will announce two webinars to be held regarding this change, one for providers and one\nfor MMCPs:\nThe State has assigned a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code and a proxy\nlocator code to each county in New York State. The applicable FIPS (if submitting electronically)\nor proxy locator (if submitting on paper) county code, indicating service location, must be\nincluded on all Children’s HCBS and CFTSS claims submitted for dates of service on or after\nDecember 1, 2023. The county FIPS and proxy locator codes are as follows:\nFederal Information Processing Proxy Locator Code for Paper Rate Region\nStandards (FIPS) County Code for Claims\nElectronic Claims\nCode County Code County Rate Region\n36001 Albany County 901 ALBANY Upstate\n36003 Allegany County 902 ALLEGANY Upstate\n36005 Bronx County 958 BRONX (The Bronx) Downstate\n36007 Broome County 903 BROOME Upstate\n36009 Cattaraugus County 904 CATTARAUGUS Upstate\n36011 Cayuga County 905 CAYUGA Upstate\n36013 Chautauqua County 906 CHAUTAUQUA Upstate\n36015 Chemung County 907 CHEMUNG Upstate\n36017 Chenango County 908 CHENANGO Upstate\n36019 Clinton County 909 CLINTON Upstate\n36021 Columbia County 910 COLUMBIA Upstate\n36023 Cortland County 911 CORTLAND Upstate\n36025 Delaware County 912 DELAWARE Upstate\n36027 Dutchess County 913 DUTCHESS Downstate\n36029 Erie County 914 ERIE Upstate\n36031 Essex County 915 ESSEX Upstate\n36033 Franklin County 916 FRANKLIN Upstate\n\nFederal Information Processing Proxy Locator Code for Paper Rate Region\nStandards (FIPS) County Code for Claims\nElectronic Claims\nCode County Code County Rate Region\n36035 Fulton County 917 FULTON Upstate\n36037 Genesee County 918 GENESEE Upstate\n36039 Greene County 919 GREENE Upstate\n36041 Hamilton County 920 HAMILTON Upstate\n36043 Herkimer County 921 HERKIMER Upstate\n36045 Jefferson County 922 JEFFERSON Upstate\n36047 Kings County 959 KINGS (Brooklyn) Downstate\n36049 Lewis County 923 LEWIS Upstate\n36051 Livingston County 924 LIVINGSTON Upstate\n36053 Madison County 925 MADISON Upstate\n36055 Monroe County 926 MONROE Upstate\n36057 Montgomery County 927 MONTGOMERY Upstate\n36059 Nassau County 928 NASSAU Downstate\n36061 New York County 960 NEW YORK (Manhattan) Downstate\n36063 Niagara County 929 NIAGARA Upstate\n36065 Oneida County 930 ONEIDA Upstate\n36067 Onondaga County 931 ONONDAGA Upstate\n36069 Ontario County 932 ONTARIO Upstate\n36071 Orange County 933 ORANGE Downstate\n36073 Orleans County 934 ORLEANS Upstate\n36075 Oswego County 935 OSWEGO Upstate\n36077 Otsego County 936 OTSEGO Upstate\n36079 Putnam County 937 PUTNAM Downstate\n36081 Queens County 961 QUEENS (Queens) Downstate\n36083 Rensselaer County 938 RENSSELAER Upstate\n36085 Richmond County 962 RICHMOND (Staten Island) Downstate\n36087 Rockland County 939 ROCKLAND Downstate\n36091 Saratoga County 941 SARATOGA Upstate\n36093 Schenectady County 942 SCHENECTADY Upstate\n36095 Schoharie County 943 SCHOHARIE Upstate\n36097 Schuyler County 944 SCHUYLER Upstate\n36099 Seneca County 945 SENECA Upstate\n36089 St. Lawrence County 940 ST LAWRENCE Upstate\n36101 Steuben County 946 STEUBEN Upstate\n36103 Suffolk County 947 SUFFOLK Downstate\n36105 Sullivan County 948 SULLIVAN Downstate\n36107 Tioga County 949 TIOGA Upstate\n36109 Tompkins County 950 TOMPKINS Upstate\n36111 Ulster County 951 ULSTER Downstate\n36113 Warren County 952 WARREN Upstate\n36115 Washington County 953 WASHINGTON Upstate\n36117 Wayne County 954 WAYNE Upstate\n36119 Westchester County 955 WESTCHESTER Downstate\nPage 2 of 3\n\nFederal Information Processing Proxy Locator Code for Paper Rate Region\nStandards (FIPS) County Code for Claims\nElectronic Claims\nCode County Code County Rate Region\n36121 Wyoming County 956 WYOMING Upstate\n36123 Yates County 957 YATES Upstate\nSubmitting Electronic Claims\nWhen submitting an electronic claim for Children’s HCBS or CFTSS effective for claims with\ndates of service on or after December 1, 2023, providers must enter Value Code 85 plus the\napplicable FIPS code from the list above in the Value Code box of the claim. Providers must\ncontinue to include any other value code that is necessary to accurately report the claim (e.g.,\nrate code) in this box.\nSubmitting Paper Claims\nWhen submitting paper claims for Children’s HCBS or CFTSS effective for claims with dates of\nservice on or after December 1, 2023, providers must enter Value Code 61 plus the\napplicable proxy locator code from the list above in the Value Code box of the claim.\nProviders must continue to include any other value code that is necessary to accurately report\nthe claim (e.g., rate code) in this box.\nSystems Updates\nThe eMedNY system is being reconfigured to associate FIPS codes to the correct proxy locator\ncodes to ensure the correct reimbursement amount is paid for each Fee for Service claim1.\nMMCPs must configure their systems to be able to accept the new billing changes from\nproviders and pay claims correctly; and to be able to submit claims to FFS for any non-risk\npayments. MMCPS have 90 days from the date of this announcement to configure their systems\nto align with these requirements and begin paying claims based on the location of service\ndelivery for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023. Providers will hold managed care\nclaims for dates of service on or after December 1, 2023.\nThe HCBS Manual, CFTSS Manual, and MCTAC Billing Tool will be updated to reflect this\nchange in billing guidance.\nQuestions about this update can be sent to: BH.Transition@health.ny.gov\n1 As a result of system reconfigurations, agencies may receive an auto-generated letter from eMedNY including\ninformation related to FIPS codes/proxy locator codes and their effective date. System effective dates may not\nalign with program/policy effective dates. Providers must follow the guidance found in this announcement and any\nsubsequent announcements released by DOH for accurate information on effective dates and policy implications.\nPage 3 of 3"
