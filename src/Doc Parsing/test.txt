Important Information for All Providers Serving Children 

Effective Ju ly 1, 2021 , as part of the New York State overall redesign of children��s healthcare and behavioral 
health systems, Medicaid-covered children/youth in f oster care will be enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care 
Plans (MMCP) unless they are otherwise excluded or exempt f rom mandatory Medicaid managed care. The 
Medicaid-covered children/youth in f oster care can either be in the care of Voluntary Foster Care Agencies 
(VFCAs) or be in f oster homes certif ied by Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) statewide. Their 
enrollment in MMCP can include Mainstream MMCP and HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV -SNP). 

Beginning in February 2021, the State will license qualif ied VFCAs pursuant to Article 29 -I of the New York 
State Public Health Law (visit: http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO : f or Laws of New Yo rk,

Facilities. Effective Ju ly 1, 2021, MMC Plans will beg in covering 29 -I Health Facility services for their 
elig ib le members. 

Effective February 1, 2021 , the Medicaid f ee-for-service (FFS) Program will update the Medicaid Foster 
Care Drug Carve -Out List with additional drug(s)/drug classes and products listed on the Pref erred Diabetic

Care Drug Carve -Out list until June 30, 2021. Effective Ju ly 1, 2021, all pharmacy benefits for this 
popu lation will be paid for under Med icaid FFS. 

All providers who deliver services to children/y outh in f oster care or to children/youth in the care of VFCAs 
should be aware of this transition. Effective Ju ly 1, 2021 , VFCAs will no longer be the payor f or Medicaid 
covered services delivered to children/youth in their care, and community providers ser ving these children will 
direct claims to the child/youth��s MMCP or the Medicaid FFS, as applicable. To avoid disruption in services 
to children/youth during this transition, providers traditionally serving this population are strongly encouraged 
to enroll in the NYS Medicaid program then engage with MMCP in their area to ensure continued coverage 
f or their patients.
